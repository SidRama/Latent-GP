Latent Gaussian process with composite likelihoods and numerical quadrature
===========================================================================================
This repository contains the python scripts used in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01614) published in the Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2021, San Diego, California, USA.

Overview
--------
In this work, we propose an unsupervised generative model that can learn a low-dimensional representation among the observations in a latent space, while making use of all available data in a heterogeneous data setting with missing values. We improve upon the existing Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM) by incorporating multiple likelihoods and deep neural network parameterised back-constraints to create a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique for heterogeneous data. In addition, we develop a variational inference method for our model that uses numerical quadrature.<br/><br/><br/>

Prerequisites
---------------
These scripts require the following software:
- Python (>= 2.6.0)
- [Theano](https://pypi.org/project/Theano/#description)(>= 0.9.0) and associated dependencies

Using our method
----------------
- Create results folder.
- Save the data files in the data folder.
- Update the necessary parameters in the run_model.py file.
- To train the **model**, run:
		`python run_model.py`
